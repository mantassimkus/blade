This file describes the implementation of the translation from guarded rules to plain datalog.

=========Description of the Input=========================

We split the input into rules that have and the rules that don't have existential variables. 
The first are *existential rules* and the rest are *full* rules

There are two rewriting rules: the first rule (F rule) generates full rules and the second  (E rule) 
generates existential rules.

==============Application of the F Rule===================
Takes an existential rule and performs the projection operation. That is, from an existential rule
we obtain a set of full rules

==============Application of the E RUle===================
Takes an existential rule and  a full rule. Generates a set of existential rules, where each
results from a different way to collapse variables of the input existential rule and  the possible ways to
 match the full rule into the existential rule.

====================Data structures used============================= 
We keep a set of existential rules and a set of full rules. We also have a job queue. There are two kinds
 of jobs (f-jobs and e-jobs). f-jobs are just given by an existential rule, while an e-job is given by 
 a pair of an existential and a universal rule.	
 
 
 ============Insertion of a new rule ================
 Suppose a f-job produces a set of full rules. The cartesian product of this set with all existential rules must be
 added to the work queue. Suppose a e-job produces a set of existential rules. The cartesian product of this set 
 with all universal  rules must be added to the work queue.
